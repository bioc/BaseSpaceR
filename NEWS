CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.x
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New high level function performOAuth() makes the App authentication easier.    
    o initializeAuth() now fires up a browser window and starts the OAuth v2 process.
      Users can use 'useBrowser' parameter to control this behaviour.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o requestAccessToken() now returns an integer giving the status of request:
        *  1 if the request was succesful and an access_token was received
	*  -1 if the AppAuth handle already contains a feasible access token
	*  An integer larger than one if the request fails.
      There is also a new 'verbose' parameter controling the messages shown to
      the user. By default 'verbose = TRUE' 


BUG FIXES

   o Added end of line character to some messages.
   o fileItem$Size is now stored as a numeric, thus allowing for file larger than 2GB.
